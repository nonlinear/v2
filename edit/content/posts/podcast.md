I'm a major podcast listener for a while. Sadly, no podcast app gives me the ability to show my subscriptions to others, so below is a compilation of the ones I follow.

If you're new to all of it, I suggest using [PocketCasts](http://www.shiftyjelly.com/pocketcasts) as a player. It's what I use.

## Design

- [99% Invisible](http://99percentinvisible.org/subscribe/)
    short stories of man-made structures mostly invisible to us.
- [The Industry Radio Show](http://theindustry.cc/category/podcast/)
    sometimes too opinionate, but nice talk on the industry I work on.
- [Shoptalk](http://shoptalkshow.com)
    less rants, more interviews, more hands-on advice. get a notepad.
